    <h1>Aaron Lei</h1>
  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>Hi there! I'm Aaron, a 13-year-old coding enthusiast with a passion for technology and creativity. Ever since I wrote my first line of code, I knew I had discovered something truly special. Programming allows me to bring my ideas to life, solve problems, and continuously learn new things. Whether I'm working on a new project or debugging code, I always find excitement in the process.

When I'm not coding, you can often find me enjoying a refreshing cup of boba. There's something about the combination of flavors and the fun of the tapioca pearls that I just can't resist.

As I continue to grow and develop my skills, I aim to create innovative and impactful projects that can make a difference. I look forward to sharing my journey with you and exploring the endless possibilities that the world of coding has to offer.

Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or just chat about all things tech (or boba)!</p>
