    <h1>Aaron Lei</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Aaron, a 13-year-old coding enthusiast with a passion for technology and creativity. Ever since I wrote my first line of code, I knew I had discovered something truly special. Programming allows me to bring my ideas to life, solve problems, and continuously learn new things. Whether I'm working on a new project or debugging code, I always find excitement in the process.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, you can often find me enjoying a refreshing cup of boba. There's something about the combination of flavors and the fun of the tapioca pearls that I just can't resist.</p>
    <p>As I continue to grow and develop my skills, I aim to create innovative and impactful projects that can make a difference. I look forward to sharing my journey with you and exploring the endless possibilities that the world of coding has to offer.</p>
    <p>Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or just chat about all things tech (or boba)!</p>

    <h2>How I got into coding</h2>
    <div class="coding-journey">
      <p>My journey into coding began when I was 8 years old, thanks to my dad. He suggested that I start learning to code, and I decided to give it a try. My first project was a simple game, and I was instantly hooked. The idea of creating something from scratch, just by typing a few lines of code, fascinated me.</p>
      <p>With my dad's encouragement, I started exploring different programming languages and online coding platforms, soaking up all the knowledge I could find. What really ignited my passion was when I successfully wrote my first program. It was a small project, but seeing it work gave me a sense of accomplishment and excitement that I had never felt before. From that moment on, I knew coding was something I wanted to dive deeper into.</p>
      <p>Since then, I’ve been creating various projects, from games to websites, and I love every moment of it. Coding allows me to be creative, solve problems, and constantly learn new things. It's a journey that keeps getting more exciting with every new project I undertake.</p>
